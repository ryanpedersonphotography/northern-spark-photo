# Image Optimization Checklist

This checklist outlines tasks to further optimize image delivery and performance on our website. Check each item as it is completed.

## Plugin Configuration
- [x] **Optimize Lazyload Settings**  
  Adjust lazyload options (e.g., `rootMargin` and `threshold`) for optimal viewport behavior.
- [ ] **Enhance Placeholder Settings**  
  Improve the blur effect and transition of placeholders for a smoother loading experience.

## Progressive Loading Strategy
- [ ] **Implement Ultra-Low Quality Placeholders**  
  Integrate a strategy to load very low-quality images first, followed by higher quality versions.
- [ ] **Progressive Image Loading**  
  Experiment with progressive image loading parameters to enhance perceived performance on slower connections.

## Leverage Cloudinary Advanced Features
- [ ] **Enable Automatic Format Detection**  
  Configure Cloudinary to automatically serve modern formats (e.g., WebP, AVIF) when supported.
- [ ] **Automatic Quality Settings**  
  Use Cloudinary's auto quality settings to balance file size and image quality.
- [ ] **Responsive Breakpoints**  
  Implement Cloudinary's responsive breakpoints API to serve optimally sized images for different viewports.

## Preloading Critical Images
- [ ] **Identify Critical Images**  
  Determine which images are critical for the initial viewport.
- [ ] **Preload Key Images**  
  Implement or refine preloading logic to ensure critical images load faster.

## Performance Monitoring & Metrics
- [ ] **Add Load Time Event Listeners**  
  Integrate event listeners to capture image load times and monitor performance.
- [ ] **Integrate Metrics Collection**  
  Set up performance monitoring to track improvements and guide further optimizations.

## Documentation & Testing
- [x] **Update Site Documentation**  
  Ensure all changes are documented, including configuration details and expected benefits.
- [ ] **Cross-Browser Testing**  
  Validate image optimization improvements across different browsers and devices.
